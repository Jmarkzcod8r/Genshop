This is like a personal log regarding this website.

* I lookep up for cheap domain names and the one named 'Genshop.biz' is promising
  in namecheap. I'm planning on using Nextjs for this one. Although my knowledge 
  about Nginx is still primitive, I will use this also along with Mongodb for the
  database. 

* This is the hierarchy of my website development as I see fit:
    (1) Database -  I'll configure this first because if something unexpected and 
                    tragic happends to the site, I can rebuild it with a new domain
                    name using the data in here.
    (2) Domain   -  I alreadt looked up some domains and I fiured namecheap would be 
                    the cheaper one so I'm going for this.
    (3) Design   -  I can use maybe Figma for this. I think I need some inspirations as well
                    for this part.
    (4) Front-end - I'll use Nextjs and tailiwnd in relation to this.
    (5) Back-end  - Yeah, let's go with axios and express.

* I'm gonna first work with the database and what it would look like. Example:
    (I may consider editing the keys to make them smaller to save up some storage space later
        down the line:)
        // Phase 1
    { "_uid"            : `{This is auto-generated}`,       // This is unique
      "e-mail"          :   `jmgutierrez122091@gmail.com`,  // This is unique
      "allownews"       :   true,   // This is if the user agree to send some news updates 
      "password"        :   `Wisdoms3`,
